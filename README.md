A project creating an online banking system using C programming language. It was built on Codeblocks.
I built this with instructions gotten from a video seen on YouTube.

To start, build and run the code using the compiler.
There will be a pop up of the output on a console. The program is pretty user friendly.
There will be two instructions to choose from on the console, either of 1 and 2. 
	1. Register an account
	2. Login to your account
Nb: it is important to ensure that you press "Enter" after making your choice
Also, it is very important to note that you have to register an account before yu can login

Some fields will be open for you to answer when you choose either of the two options, ensure that no white space is written as part of your answer, very important.
Also, Phone number and Password is part of the field, ensure you nte them down as this will most likely be required one time or the other during your transaction.

NB: At some point, you might get to the Online transfer part. It is important to note that you can't send money to someone that is not registered also.

Thank you for looking through this.
